Assignment (UXD225)
Project 1: Map

"You will create an informative and/or entertaining and/or useful user experience using a map in Leaflet. Your topic can be any you choose. The map should include some form of interaction, and it should help the user to gain some information, learn something, or be entertaining."

Extraterrestrial Investigation-- JS Map

My work for this project was inspired by the movie Paul, wherein two adult sci-fi geeks take an extraterrestrial-themed roadtrip across the US and make friends with an alien.

I decided to plot some major sites of interest for sci-fi fans, marked by alien heads and connected via Leaflet Routing machine. When a user clicks on the markers, a pop-up reveals some basic information about the site along with a photo.

On a separate layer from the roadtrip, users toggle on/off a visual representation of UFO sightings by state (information pulled from the National UFO Reporting Center). A control in the upper right-hand corner shows the number of sightings for the specific state that the user is hovering over (or taps on for mobile devices).
